                        <p id="accordion-content">As you can clearly see, I have created my own website. This I have
                            built from scratch. I started off building a wireframe in Adobe Xd, before writing the
                            site in VSCode, creating a repository on github and then finally launching live! The website
                            is far from how I would like it to, so I'm currently working on numerous aspects to make it
                            even better. I have various ideas to demonstrate my knowledge of Javascript on the website
                            as well and I will be working on these in the coming weeks.<br /><br /> If you would like to see the repository for the site, you can visit it

                        <p id="accordion-content">CodeCademy has been an invaluable source of learning for me. I have
                            started on the Web Development Path where I complete a countless hours of lessons, projects,
                            quizes, articles and videos on HTML, CSS and Javascript (jQuery, React, Node, etc). I have
                            learnt how to use Command Line, SQL, API's and more. In addition to this I have also picked
                            up learning C# from their courses.</p>

                        <p id="accordion-content">SoloLearn was a fantastic way to test the waters with code. The
                            gamification of simple HTML, CSS and Javascript re-introduced me to the idea that this was something I
                            enjoyed doing. At the peak of learning with SoloLearn I regularly topped the leader boards
                            in Norway.</p>

                        <p id="accordion-content">As a small company, we often had the opportunity to be involved in
                            various different projects. One of the projects I often contributed to was the UX
                            development of the JetKids website. This started off from a copyright and artwork side and
                            then more and more I saw myself interested in the backend. This was one of the reasons that
                            made me decide to pick up learning to code again.</p>

                        <p id="accordion-content">As one of the first generations to have access to the internet freely
                            growing up, I often spent my free time exploring this new world. At one point I began
                            exploring html and css to the point I could confidently navigate myself through basic code
                            and edit websites. Unbeknown to me was how I was actually learning an essential skill. My IT
                            teachers had not covered coding, my parents told me I was wasting my told as so I eventually
                            dropped it.</p>
