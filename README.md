# portfoliowebsite

This is my portfolio website. Viewed at https://aliceinnorway.github.io/portfoliowebsite/index.html 

The idea is to display my coding projects, career, education and a little about myself in a non-github/non-CV format.
This is also a demonstration of some of the things I have learnt whilst studying.

There are several aspects I want to add to the website. My plans are to create a more complicated "Contact Me" part, with a message box.
I would also like to turn the timelines into one React-based interactive timeline.

Finally, and most importantly, I need to work on getting the website responsive and mobile friendly.
